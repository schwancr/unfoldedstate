For protein L, these are the fret experiments we can fit:

1) Sherman, E. and Haran G. PNAS (2006)
http://www.pnas.org/content/103/31/11539.full.pdf+html

    They have a his-tagged n-terminus (HHA-proteinL) and say that they
        inserted cysteines at positions 1 and 64 
    Our sequence has a MET and a GLY at positions 1 and 64, so the probes
        were inserted at the n- and c-termini

2) Merchant et al. 10.1073/pnas.0607097104.

    They have a protein L version with 65 residues, corresponding to this 
        sequence:

    CEEV...FAGC

    Where the C's are the labeled sites. This corresponds to replacing our 
        methionine (1) and appending a cysteine onto the c-terminus

    They get similar results to (1), so we can probably still use this data.


So, these papers predict a radius of gyration for the unfolded state
    at both 0M and 6M GdmCl:

         Rg @ 0M [nm] | Rg @ 6M [nm] 
    (1):         1.71 |         2.89
    (2):         1.98 |         3.03

Additionally, each paper reports the FRET efficiency distribution since
    these are single molecule experiments. We are waiting on email 
    correspondences to get all of that data. For now we can fit to the mean
